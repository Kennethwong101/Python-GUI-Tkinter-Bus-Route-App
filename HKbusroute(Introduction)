I am recently making a Bus Route system which can search all HK Bus route info such as the price, journey time and location
from start to end. The core coding part is using python package - tkinter to build the UI and parse XML dataset by using 
beautifulsoup package. It can be enhanced as AI chatbot with conversation function.

XML Data Source from Data.Gov.HK
